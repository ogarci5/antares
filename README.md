##Antares

Antares is a task manager/dashboard that includes different APIs for the technologies I use. Antares was made to solve the time management problems I've been having.

###Karen
Karen is a rake task with some fancy configuration that essentially sends out reminders using Twilio. That way if any of the tasks I have set are due, Karen will attempt to remind me in a not so boring fashion. Karen will eventually be put in her own gem and run from there.
